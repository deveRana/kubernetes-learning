# Kubernetes Learning Repository

Welcome to my Kubernetes learning journey! This repository serves as a personal collection of notes, guides, and YAML files I will be creating as I explore and learn Kubernetes concepts. The goal of this repository is to document and share the various topics I will cover and implement.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Learning Notes:** Each topic will have a dedicated folder containing detailed markdown notes.
- **YAML Files:** For each concept, I will include relevant YAML configurations to demonstrate practical Kubernetes applications.
- **Deployment Strategies:** From simple deployments to complex strategies like Blue-Green deployments, youâ€™ll find clear examples of how to implement them.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or concept.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - A markdown file with detailed explanations and steps.
  - The necessary YAML files for that concept (e.g., deployments, services, etc.).
- **Example:** The "Blue-Green Deployment" folder contains:
  - A markdown guide explaining the steps.
  - YAML files for `rana-deployment.yaml`, `rushi-deployment.yaml`, and `unnati-service.yaml`.

## Goal

The purpose of this repository is to have an organized space for me to track my learning progress in Kubernetes. As I continue to explore more advanced topics, this repository will grow and evolve with my knowledge.

Feel free to check out the folders, and if you find something useful or would like to contribute, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request!

## Topics Covered (so far)
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: A strategy for zero-downtime deployments using load balancing between two application versions.
- More topics will be added as I progress.

Thank you for visiting my Kubernetes learning repository!
